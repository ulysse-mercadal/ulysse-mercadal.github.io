RFC XXXX                Protocole R-Type v1.0.1        28 November 2025


1. Introduction to the R-Type Protocol

   The R-Type Protocol is a lightweight, modular network protocol
   designed to enable real-time multiplayer communication between a
   game client (specifically the R-Type 3D client) and a dedicated
   server.


2. Goals

   The protocol was built with the following key objectives:

   - Modularity & Reusability: It is intentionally decoupled from
     game logic, making it adaptable to virtually any real-time
     multiplayer game - not just R-Type.

   - Performance: To minimize latency, the protocol uses TCP only
     for the initial connection handshake, then switches to UDP for
     all gameplay data, ensuring fast and efficient transmission.

   - Bandwidth Efficiency: Game data is packaged into compact binary
     messages that may contain multiple commands (e.g., movement +
     shooting + state change) in a single packet, reducing overall
     network overhead.


3. Communication Flow

   1. Initial Connection (TCP)
      The client establishes a TCP connection to the server to
      perform a secure handshake: exchanging version info,
      authentication tokens, and receiving a unique session ID.

   2. Gameplay Communication (UDP)
      After the session is validated, all real-time gameplay
      updates - such as player input, entity states, and events -
      are transmitted over UDP. This provides the low-latency
      responsiveness required for fast-paced action games.

   3. Multiplexed Packets
      Each UDP packet can carry one or more commands. This batching
      mechanism optimizes bandwidth usage and reduces packet count,
      which is crucial for maintaining smooth synchronization under
      varying network conditions.

   It contains no hardcoded game logic, allowing seamless
   integration into other game engines or genres (e.g., platformers,
   shooters, real-time strategy) with minimal adaptation.

4. Header and Body

   The command are split in two main parts the header and the body.
   The header contains information about the command, the sender,
   and the body size. The body contains the additional information
   (name, positions, status...)

   This document serves as the foundation for the full R-Type
   Protocol specification. Subsequent sections will detail packet
   structures, supported command types, sequence numbering, and
   strategies for handling packet loss in UDP streams.


5. Protocol Commands

   Each message in the R-Type Protocol is identified by an 8-bit
   command ID. The same ID may be used for related actions (e.g.,
   client request and server broadcast), and the exact meaning is
   determined by the header. Below is the complete list of supported
   commands.

   Note:
   - All commands respect the 512-byte packet limit. Large payloads
     (e.g., long messages) must be split across multiple packets.
   - The same command ID is used for both requests and
     notifications/responses

    int this command array, B collumv goes for broadcast

6. Protocol Limitations

   Param size:

   - This ptococole can't have more than 255 versions id, because
     it's a uint8

   - A server can't host more than 255 players, because it's a uint8

   - A server can't host more than 255 lobbys, because it's a uint8

   - A lobby can't host more than 255 players, because it's a uint8

   - You can't handle more than 255 input keys id, because it's a
     uint8

   - A player name must be a string with a length between 1, and 20
     chars

   - A lobby name must be a string with a length between 1, and 20
     chars

   - A level can't have more than 65534 npcs because it's a uint16

   - A player can't take more than 65534 dammages because it's a
     uint16

7. Packet Structure

   The R-Type Protocol uses a uniform binary packet format for all
   communication, whether sent over TCP (e.g., during handshake or
   reliable control messages) or UDP (for real-time gameplay
   updates). This ensures consistency across transport layers while
   allowing the protocol to remain transport-agnostic at the message
   level.

   7.1. General Rules

   - Maximum size per packet: 512 bytes (including header and body).

   - A single packet may contain one or more concatenated commands.

   - If the total data exceeds 512 bytes, it must be split into
     multiple packets.

   - Each command is self-contained and consists of a 2-byte header
     + an optional body (0 to 510 bytes).

   - Command bodies are optional: some commands have an empty body
     (body length = 0), while others carry structured game data.

   Note: Even during the TCP handshake phase, messages follow this
   exact format. The transport layer (TCP vs. UDP) affects delivery
   guarantees and latency, not the message encoding.


8. Command Format

   Each command starts with a 2-byte (16-bit) header, followed by a
   body whose length is declared in the header.

   8.1. Header Layout (2 bytes)

   +----------+---------------+------------------------------------+
   | Bits     | Field         | Description                        |
   +----------+---------------+------------------------------------+
   | 15-14    | Direction     | 2-bit direction code (e.g., 00 =  |
   |          |               | request, 01 = response - semantics |
   |          |               | defined by context)                |
   +----------+---------------+------------------------------------+
   | 13-9     | Command ID    | 5-bit unsigned integer (0-31)      |
   |          |               | identifying the command type       |
   +----------+---------------+------------------------------------+
   | 8-0      | Body Length   | 9-bit unsigned integer (0-511)     |
   |          |               | indicating the size of the body    |

   |          |               | in bytes                           |
   +----------+---------------+------------------------------------+

   The body length does not include the 2-byte header... well
   because a header is not a body :)

   8.2. Visual bit layout:

   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   | D| D| I| I| I| I| I| L| L| L| L| L| L| L| L| L|
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   Where:
   - D = Direction (2 bits -> 4 possible values)
   - I = Command ID (5 bits -> max 31)
   - L = Body length (9 bits -> max 511)


9. Usage Across Transports

   +----------+-------------------------------+----------------------+
   |Transport | Typical Use Case              | Packet Handling      |

   9.1. Example

   An EXAMPLE command (ID = 10) with a 4-byte body sent with
   direction code 01:

   - Direction = 01
   - ID = 10 -> binary 01010
   - Body length = 4 -> binary 000000100

   Full 16-bit header (big-endian):
   01 01010 000000100 -> grouped as two bytes:

   - Byte 0: 01010100 = 0x54
   - Byte 1: 00000100 = 0x04

   Header sent: 0x54 0x04

   Followed by 4 bytes of payload data.


10. Command Specifications

10.1. Connection (ID 0)

   This command is used to initiate and accept a new client
   connection to the server. It is the first message sent by a
   client after opening a TCP socket. The server responds to
   indicate whether the connection is accepted (e.g., due to version
   compatibility or server capacity).

   Warning! This command must be sent over TCP. It is part of the
   initial handshake phase.

   10.1.1. Client -> Server

   Context:
   The client attempts to connect to the server and declares the
   protocol version it supports.

   +--------------+--------+----------------------------------+


10.2. Disconnection (ID 1)

   This command is used to terminate a session - either initiated by
   the client (voluntary leave) or by the server (kick).

   Warning! This command uses TCP exclusively.

   If a player is in an active match, you may want to first send a
   game-level leave notification (e.g., LEAVE_LOBBY) before issuing
   this command.

   10.2.1. Client -> Server

   Context:
   The client requests a graceful disconnection from the server.
