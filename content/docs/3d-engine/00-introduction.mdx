Our custom C++ 3D engine is built for real-time rendering in game-like applications. It emphasizes **modularity**, **debuggability**, and **cross-platform compatibility** (currently Linux-focused, but with Windows supported).

## Core Dependencies

- **[OpenGL 4.6+](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/)** – Programmable rendering pipeline
- **[GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)** – Mathematics (vectors, matrices, quaternions)
- **[Assimp](https://www.assimp.org/)** – Model parsing (`.fbx`, `.obj`; `.glTF` planned)
- **[stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)** – Texture loading (PNG, JPG, TGA, etc.)
- **[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) + [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)** – Window creation and OpenGL context/extension management
- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)** – Build system (Linux-native workflow with `FetchContent`)


To compile the game engine, just use our CMake, it will fetch our Dependencies by itself

## Key Features

- Entity-based scene graph (`GameObject` system)
- Full transform control (position, rotation, scale)
- Shader pipeline with uniform binding abstraction
- Skeletal animation support (`.FBX` only, `.GLTF` in the future)
- Material and texture system with debug validation
- Scene-level resource management
