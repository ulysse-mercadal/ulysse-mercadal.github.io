# Entities

Entities are the primary objects in the ECS world. An entity is essentially just an ID (unique identifier).

## The `Entity` Class

The `Entity` class is a lightweight wrapper around a `size_t` ID and a generation count (used to recycle IDs safely).

```cpp
class Entity {
public:
    std::size_t id() const;
    std::size_t generation() const;
    // ...
};
```

## Managing Entities

All entity management is done through the `Registry`.

### Spawning an Entity

To create a new entity, use `spawnEntity()`. This returns an `Entity` object.

```cpp
Registry registry;
Entity myEntity = registry.spawnEntity();
```

### Killing an Entity

To destroy an entity, use `killEntity(entity)`. This will also automatically remove all components associated with this entity.

```cpp
registry.killEntity(myEntity);
```

### Lifecycle

1.  **Creation**: When `spawnEntity()` is called, the `EntityManager` finds a free ID. If recycled IDs are available, it reuses one (incrementing its generation). Otherwise, it creates a new ID.
2.  **Destruction**: When `killEntity()` is called, the `Registry` invokes registered "erasers" to remove components from all sparse arrays for that entity ID. The ID is then returned to the pool of free IDs.
