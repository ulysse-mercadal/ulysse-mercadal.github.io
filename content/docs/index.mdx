Welcome to the **R-Type** project documentation!
This documentation covers the three core components of our implementation:

- **3D Engine**: Responsible for rendering and scene management.
- **Network Protocol**: Handles communication between clients and server.
- **Game Engine**: Orchestrates game logic, entities, and systems.
