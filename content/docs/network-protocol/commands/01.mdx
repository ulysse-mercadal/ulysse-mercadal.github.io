title: 0x01 - Disconnection
description: Gracefully disconnect or forcibly kick a client from the server.

# Disconnection (ID 1)

This command is used to **terminate a session**—either initiated by the client (voluntary leave) or by the server (kick).

> warning! **This command uses TCP exclusively.**

> If a player is in an active match, you may want to first send a game-level leave notification (e.g., `LEAVE_LOBBY`) before issuing this command.

## Client → Server

### Context
The client requests a graceful disconnection from the server.

### Header
| Direction | Code  | Body Length |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| `01`           | `00001`   | `000000000`      |

**Raw header bytes (big-endian):** `0x42 0x00`

*(Binary: `01 00001 000000000` - `01000010 00000000`)*

### Body
None.

## Server → Client

### Context
The server forcibly disconnects (kicks) the client, optionally providing a reason.

### Header
| Direction | Code  | Body Length |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| `00`           | `00001`   | *N*              |

Where *N* is the length of the reason string (≤ 510 bytes to respect the 512-byte packet limit).

**Example (reason = ratio!!):**

Body length = `8` - `000001000`

Header bytes: `0x02 0x08`

*(Binary: `00 00001 000001000` - `00000010 00001000`)*

### Body

| Size (bytes) | Type     | Content              |
|:------------:|:--------:|----------------------|
| *N* (0–510)  | `string` | UTF-8 reason message |

> If the body length is `0`, no reason is provided (silent kick).
