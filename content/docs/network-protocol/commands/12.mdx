## Server -> Client

### Context
The server notifies clients that a player entity has been destroyed (e.g., hit by enemy, out of bounds).

### Header
| Direction | Code  | Body Length |
|:---------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| `00`      | `01100` | *N*         |

> Where *N* = Dead player name (1–20 bytes).

### Example (name = "Michel"):

Body length = `7` - `000000111`

**Raw header bytes:** `0x18 0x07`

*(Binary: `00 01100 000000111` - `00011000 00000111`)*

### body

| Size (bytes) | Type     | Content               |
|:------------:|:--------:|:----------------------|
| *N*          | `string` | Dead player name      |
