title: 0x0E - Move
description: Updates a player’s position in 3D space (x, y, z) using scaled integers.

# Move (ID 14)

This command is sent by the server to notify a client of a player's updated position in 3D space. Positions are encoded as 16-bit signed integers scaled by 0.01 for bandwidth efficiency.

> **This command must be sent over UDP.**

> **This command can only be sent by the server!**

## Server -> Client

### Context
The server broadcasts the new coordinates of a player entity after simulating movement. World positions are converted to scaled integers before transmission.

### Header
| Direction | Code  | Body Length |
|:---------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| `00`      | `01110` | `000000111` |

### Example:

Body length = `7` -> `000000111`

**Raw header bytes:** `0x1C 0x07`

*(Binary: `00 01110 000000111` - `00011100 00000111`)*

### Body
| Size (bytes) | Type     | Content                                |
|:------------:|:--------:|:---------------------------------------|
| 1            | `uint8`  | Player ID                              |
| 2            | `int16`  | X position (world = value * 0.01)      |
| 2            | `int16`  | Y position (world = value * 0.01)      |
| 2            | `int16`  | Z position (world = value * 0.01)      |
